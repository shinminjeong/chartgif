0:23;;0:44;;It was very interesting to see that during the ealy 1800s most conuntries were all in a similar situation income/life expectancy wise. Especially including countries in Africa that we tend to associate as being poorer with a lower life expectancy. So to see them as similar with European countries is very unexpected.|1:2;;1:7;;Looking at the traces of the bubbles especially during the industrial revolution period clearly highlights the differences between whats occuring in the countries and starting to begin to see the the African countries move lower on the graphy whilst European countries move in an upper trajectory.|1:7;;1:49;;By individually highlighting each continent you can clearly see how dramatic of an impact the First World War had on all continents. Bubbles make it very clear. The drop in the African income/life expectancy is staggering.|1:52;;1:59;;In 1933 seeing the sudden increase in life expectancy in Kazakhstan and other Central Asian countries makes me curious to find out what was causing this suddent increase.|2:8;;2:19;;Being able to look at the different directions of the countries during the Second World War clearly shows how the war impacted all the countries in various ways, with some being affected a lot worse.|2:37;;2:52;;By using the bubbles you can see a stark difference between Australia/ New Zealand/Western/Southern Asia compared to North & South Korea, Japan. As you've got Australia etc continuing the rise slowly whilst Japan and Korea struggling.|3:4;;3:14;;It's interesting to see that in 1975 the difference between the countries was wider than ever and begs the question what exactly about 1975 made this happen.|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:45;;0:47;;I could not read and dialogue but a clear massive drop life expectancy at this stage of the graph in Africa|1:15;;1:32;;A dreadful time for humanity woth the millions killed in world War 1 then the Spanish flu pandemic as well so sad|2:14;;2:52;;I found it very surprising that in the lead up to and including the whole of Workd War 2 there was an increase in populations of many countries and these countries were ones that had very many soldiers fighting and yowns and cities being bombed|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:50;;0:58;;It is interesting that the industrial revolution had an impact on life expectancy in europe but not asia and africa, causing greater disparity between the continents|1:10;;1:26;;I liked that the video showed all of the continents' data at once and then slowed the video down and analysed each country's data individually so you could see how the world war and the flu influenced each area individually|2:26;;2:34;;It is interesting to see what a great impact war has on life expectancy, reducing some countries' life expectancy to just over 20 years old which is shocking|3:6;;3:13;;It's interesting to see all of the countries advancing in life expectancy and wealth but some countries advancing further, creating great disparity|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:49;;1:5;;It is interesting how European countries saw an increased income from 1815 to 1915, and the majority of the remaining countries stayed relatively static. This demonstrates strong economic growth in Europe compared to other territories.|1:7;;1:16;;The trace of bubbles here clearly exemplifies how horrific the mortality rate was globally (with only a few small exceltions) as a result of the Spanish Flu & World War 1. No country saw an increase in life expectancy between 1917-1919.|1:16;;1:24;;Australia and New Zealand are by far has the wealthiest citizens and longest life expectancy compared to the rest of Asia during the period of 1917-1919.|1:54;;2:1;;Interesting to see how Central Asia and Kazakhstan dramatically improve their life expectancy to be more relatable to the rest of the region in 1933-1934. The graph illustrates this very clearly.|3:5;;3:9;;The genreal trend of income of different countries becomes wider as the years progress, showing a wider disparity in economic/wealth levels as certain countries progress as other countries economies remain very weak. Europe and America remain strong throughout, but certain smaller Asian (Middle Eastern) countries (E.g. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait) develop high income (making their income from oil etc.)|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:9;;0:17;;The different colours of the bubbles make it easy to track each region.|1:10;;1:49;;It is almost shocking to note the huge drop in life expectancy as a result of the first world war, the shifting bubbles make it very clear.|1:53;;2:8;;It is helpful so see different parts of various regions broken down individually.|2:55;;3:5;;I didn't realise how significant the overall increase in income and life exceptancy was between 1950-1975, the graph illustrates this very well.|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:46;;0:52;;it is interesting to know how small life expectancy was in different countries|1:3;;1:7;;It is interesting to visually see how the life expectancy increases and so does the income|1:17;;2:41;;It is fascinating to see what the effects of the flu had around the world|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:31;;0:42;;Interesting to show where africa & Asia did not move and relating this to their current state.The question would be why a colonized state of a firs-world country such as UK would not benefit anywhere near that of the leading countr in life expactancy, as shown.|0:51;;1:16;;Beginning links to previous segment.Huge drop was interesting to watch, some countries move left only?A note would be good to explain this maybe.|2:13;;2:43;;Could see EU was the focus of battle withother countries remaining relatively stable.|2:53;;3:6;;An answer to a previous comment, a huge lag-time was clear thoughof 60 odd-years.|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:48;;1:5;;It is interesting at first to see European countries starting to rise and how much compared to the other colors.|1:7;;1:12;;the drop really helps demonstrate how severe this truly was at the time from 1917-1919|2:1;;2:8;;the way life expectancy dropped and then a year later was able to rise back up again is very interesting and the way you can see exactly the amount|2:13;;2:19;;the second world war can been seen here how it affected different area in many different ways and really can show how complex it was as an event for the world.|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:1;;0:7;;The axes of the graph are explained in terms which are simple enough for laymen to understand.|0:8;;0:20;;What each bubble represents is explained clearly, and it is interesting to note that at the start of the 19th century, the income and life expectancy levels in Asia and Africa were lower than those of American & European countries.|0:22;;0:27;;Interestingly, the variance of life expectancy between that of the country with the highest and that of the lowest was only around 20-30 years (excluding an outlying African country).|0:39;;0:49;;There is an African country in which the life expectancy fell dramatically in 1819, but this eventually recovers (or the country ceases to exist?) in 4 years' time.|1:8;;1:15;;It is interesting to note that the First World War and Spanish Flu Pandemic resulted in a marked drop in life expectancy in all countries worldwide, regardless of wealth at the time.|1:53;;1:59;;The life expectancy in Kazakhstan increased by almost 40 years between the years 1933 to 1934.|2:10;;2:54;;The life expectancy for different countries moved in different directions in the Second World War, a contrast to that of the First which resulted in a global decrease.|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:0;;0:6;;It was good seeing what each axis represented and the blue writing really helped to summarise the meaning.|0:9;;0:16;;I liked seeing the different colours representing different continents but it was hard to remember which colour was which.|0:18;;0:20;;It was interesting that different sizes of bubbles mean different populations because in the rest of the video I forget about the bubble sizes altogether.|0:21;;0:48;;This whole section of not much happening helped me to understand how rapid the changes were later on (although it did put me off watching further because not much was happening).|0:49;;1:4;;Watching Europe gradually creep upwards was cool. The comment about colonized countries made me wonder if colonization itself hindered those countries or if they weren't making those advances due to other reasons (lack of resources or something).|1:10;;1:12;;Watching the whole world drop in life expectancy like that was very impressive and also very scary given we have a global pandemic right now.|1:17;;1:47;;Highlighting individual regions really helped me see how each region was separately impacted over those years.|1:55;;1:59;;The grey blobs shifting upwards all at once really emphasised what a big change it was across the whole region, not just in one country.|2:1;;2:6;;I got distracted by the life expectancy dropping but no real indication as to WHY that happened. Was there a war?|2:6;;2:7;;The fade lines where the bubbles used to be work really well here because they are so long, which shows how rapidly the situation changed.|2:23;;2:34;;I wasn't sure why Europe was grouped into two different grey blobs or how you chose to group the countries.|2:52;;2:55;;Watching all the countries climbing higher up the life expectancy line is great. I love how the world as a whole is moving upwards with all the bubbles visible at once.|2:59;;3:4;;Watching the whole world getting healthier and richer is so uplifting!|3:24;;3:27;;Wow! Even the African countries that we usually assume are poorer and struggling more are still way better off than they were at the start of the video. This was so uplifting! The world is really becoming a better place.|-|-
0:0;;0:3;;A very small detail, but if you specify Income is the x-axis and Life Expectancy is the y-axis, that would help even more. Though this may not be necessary since you do show a label when you mention them, and I'm not sure how comfortable general viewers may be with the terms x- and y-axis.|"0:4;;0:20;;This whole section is very helpful in understanding what is happening in the graph. A lot of clear visual aids, maybe give some context as to how much population is represented in each bubble (e.g. Having a visual in the corner saying ""A bubble this big represents 1 million people"" could help viewers understand the size of the countries better)."|0:20;;0:29;;Is the reason for Asia, Africa and America not changing much in this early time period due to a lack of population size measuring? Might be useful to mention that, as I imagine European countries, which show the fluctuations in population size, would have had more resources and reason to take measurements like this at the time.|0:42;;0:46;;I like the labelling of countries of interest. It might be nice to see some countries labelled throughout the entire graph cycle, such as the UK, US, China, India, etc. Though, this could also be distracting to the overall message.|"0:49;;1:4;;I'm very much nitpicking, but the comment here makes it sound like you're saying the continents of Asia and Africa are ""colonized countries"", whereas ""the colonized countries in Asia and Africa"" would sound clearer. Also, you don't mention the growing disparity in America (I'm guessing the US and Canada shot ahead here?) and (I'm guessing) the seperation of Western/Northern Europe from Eastern Europe, which are interesting to see."|1:9;;1:15;;That was a powerful image. I liked the slowdown and the traces, made the changes very clear and profound.|1:41;;1:47;;I like the finer-grain seperation of the boxes - helps to see the differences between groups of nations much better. I'm surprised to see the huge drop in population expectancy for sub-saharan Africa - I'm guessing this is more from the Spanish flu? I don't often see much talk about the effect of the Flu on Africa, or WW1's effect on the continent for that matter.|2:13;;2:19;;The slowed-down version is much easier to read, since otherwise it's a bunch of coloured circles changing spaces randomly. But the almost random changes in this period are extremely interesting, and it's nice to see the trail as countries move around year-by-year.|2:20;;2:39;;Moldova is its own block here because in one year it falls dramatically out of line with other countries in its grouping. I understand why, but it's strange to see. Maybe instead of this solution you could ignore the outliers when drawing the group's grey box? This would make the block more generalisable and less strangely shaped, which has happened a few times already in the video.|2:42;;2:49;;Like I said in the last comment, the Western, Southern and South-Eastern Asia group is stretched extremely far by one or two outliers to the right. Maybe ignoring them when drawing the box would make it more representative of the group as a whole, because a box that big isn't saying much about the group. Also, which countries are the outliers here? You don't label them.|3:25;;3:30;;Maybe showing the modern powers in this shot would be nice for comparison?|-|-|-|-|-
1:6;;1:50;;The trails and splitting up of the groups helps me understand how significant the impact of war and disease were worldwide.|2:0;;2:3;;It's interesting how Eastern European life expectancies dropped in the space of a year.|3:6;;3:9;;It's interesting to see how stark the difference is between Sub-Saharan Africa and the rest of the world.|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:31;;0:43;;Splitting the video by continent helped me to understand better how different continents were affected by changes in life expectancy|1:34;;1:41;;It is interesting that Argentina seems to be considerably better off than the rest of South America, with a higher life expectancy as well|1:53;;2:8;;The fact that first Central and Asia and then Eastern Europe dropped and then increased in life expectancy is interesting, as is the fact that the Asian countries are very variable in health and wealth|2:23;;2:41;;Pointing to individual countries on the graph helped me see more clearly how different countries were affected by the Second World War|3:8;;3:15;;I expected Middle Eastern countries to be wealthier but I was surprised how much higher the life expectancy is as well|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:3;;0:20;;Hard to remember which bubble colour is why group. Should put aw legend that shows.|0:28;;0:50;;Before the industrial revolution there was so little change so it felt like our species wasn't really evolving or anything since theres no changes.|0:53;;1:3;;Can see europe pulling away from the rest of the world and being the best. Still a trend across many things right now.|1:3;;1:48;;Despite the major impacts of the war and the flu it was interesting how quickly these threats left and normal life began again by looking at how the life expectancy recover.|1:56;;3:2;;This very long period of increase in wealth and life expectancy is interesting even through WWII life expectancy still rose. shows just how much the world is changing in the last 100 years.|3:2;;3:30;;unfortunately africa and majority of asia and then south america are always lagging behind north america and europe which are generally more privilleged countries. hopefully this changes and thise injustice is erased although I doubt it will happen soon.|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:32;;0:33;;It's interesting that countries in Asia did not move between 1800 and 1820|0:39;;0:40;;Its interesting that the African countries also stayed the same in the 1800s|0:50;;0:51;;It's interesting that Europe life expectancies are increasing but not the countries that they've colonised. Wealth should be spread amongst all countries, not just 1.|1:0;;1:1;;As the years go on, it's interesting that it's mostly Europe who's income is increasing, with very few Asian and African countries moving in the same direction|1:20;;1:22;;I can't believe that life expectancy dropped so suddenly for Asia between 1917 and 1919|1:30;;1:32;;Its interesting that Europe went through the same changes in income and life expectancy as Asia between 1917 and 1919|1:39;;1:40;;It's interesting that all continents experienced a decrease in life expectancy|1:55;;1:58;;It would be interesting to know the reason as to why there was an increase in life expectancy in Kazakhstan and Central Asia|2:4;;2:6;;I would have thought that Europe's life expectancy continued to increase at a gradual rate so it's interesting that it dropped a bit in 1934 although recovered the year after|2:12;;2:19;;It's interesting to see that all countries fluctuated a lot throughout the Second World War|2:23;;2:26;;It's expected that the life expectancy of a continent would drop during a war and seeing the bubbles helps me understand this further|2:32;;2:39;;The bubbles fluctuate so much throughout this time - it's expected but surprising that they increased overall|2:41;;2:51;;It seems that the general average of life expectancy and income doesn't increase at all over these years like Europe. everything stayed stagnant|2:54;;3:4;;it seems right that as soon as countries become independent, they'll become wealthier overall|3:8;;3:14;;it's crazy to see how much things fluctuated between all continents|3:14;;3:19;;it seems unfair that Africa was the main continent to be affected and unable to catch up with other continents in terms of income and life expectancy
0:54;;1:8;;the fact that every country started out the same|1:28;;1:36;;the fact that everyone got affected life expectancy wise|2:3;;2:6;;goes to show no one is immune to illness|2:32;;2:45;;Shows the negative impact of war|2:58;;3:5;;Shows if everyone has their independant ways of living and lifestyle they will do much better.|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:50;;1:5;;It is intresting how all countries move horizontal in a cluster togther then Europe take of upwards compared to the other areas.|1:5;;1:12;;The spanish flu and the first world ward impacted the world hugely with most countries seeing a drop in life expetency. To see such a big drop makes you realise the severity.|1:32;;1:33;;Europe suffered massively with one country going down to as low as 10.|0:1;;3:30;;The full clip helped understand how changes in life expectency differed from region to region but in 1917-1919 they were all impacted by the spanish flu and/ or the first world war.|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:25;;0:28;;That African country at the bottom had a huge fall and I'm not sure what country it is but it stood out a lot.|0:50;;1:5;;The progress of the European countries compared to the others is unbelievable.|1:9;;1:16;;Really interesting seeing Mauritous stay un-affected by those 2 global disasters. But then fall back at the end.|1:40;;1:48;;Seychelles does the same as Mauritious, stays the same while others go down, goes down while others recover.|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:49;;1:7;;I found it interesting to watch the effect of the industrial revolution increasing the income of all countries to some extent, but only increasing the life expectancy in Europe/America|1:7;;1:48;;The effect of WW1 and the Spanish Flu is very significant on life expectancy worldwide|2:10;;2:55;;The effect of WW2 on all countries is very interesting, and the visualization shows the significance and the impact of these events on the world.|3:7;;3:16;;The large difference between different parts of the world is surprising|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
1:7;;1:13;;It is interesting to see a sharp drop in life expectancy in a very large proportion of countries in the world. Although this was expected as a result of a global pandemic|0:54;;1:6;;Very interesting to see a steady incline in life expectancy, as most countries were increase steadily towards the richer and healthier lifestyle|0:27;;0:42;;Very interesting how life expectancy did not improve in Africa over the years between 1818 to almost the 20th century, even when other countries started experiencing an increase.|0:51;;1:9;;Interesting that before the war, Europe showed a great incline in life expectancy as compared to the rest of the world|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:43;;0:46;;Life expectancy below 40 in UK in 1811 is quite strange to hearand would be considered a life barely lived today.|1:56;;1:59;;The sudden rise of life expectancy in central Asia was interestingThe bubble in the diagrams were helpful here.|2:55;;2:58;;It seems all are current problems with climate change started in the 1950's|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
1:6;;1:12;;I thought it was insightful to how the countries gradually dropped from 1917 through 1918 and eventually rising back in 1919. The trail left from the population when it changed, helped made it easier to see how the life expectancy relative to the income changed over time.|1:53;;2:0;;The bubbles outlining the points were effective in contrasting the countries change in life expectancy overtime|2:40;;2:45;;The labels and different sized points helped to differentiate between the growth/decrease of certains countries and their populations.|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:47;;0:53;;Interesting to compare Europe to Asia and Africa|1:8;;1:34;;This impact of the Spanish flu is fascinating in the context of Corona|2:18;;2:48;;Fascinating to compare the differences between Europe and Asia during this time|3:4;;3:20;;Really interesting to me as I was born in 1975|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:49;;1:5;;I wasn't aware of the incredible difference in quality of life between America/Europe and Asia/Africa during the industrial revolution.|1:7;;1:50;;The short term, but significant, drops in life expectancy worldwide between 1917-1919 from WWI are really put into perspective with the bubble tracking.|1:49;;2:8;;The steady upward progression of the general world and the massive jumps from poorer Eastern European countries in the 1920s and 30s after what I presume is related to the post Russian Revolution was intruiging to watch.|2:12;;2:31;;I am surprised that the income of people generally wasn't affected negatively during WWII compared to WWI|2:52;;3:29;;The steady growth and evening out of life expectancy with the growing disparity of wealth between the continents/countries in the 20th century post WWII was not as significant as I expected. Especially that of Western Asia and some Middle Eastern Countries.|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:11;;0:17;;I like the color coding of the different regions of the world.|1:5;;1:12;;I like seeing when there is an outlier in the data, that it shows which countries/regions they come from.|"1:3;;1:5;;Everyone is making references to the Spanish flu these days but I don't think Corona was that deadly. Kinda funny too cause People are calling it the ""china flu"" But when people talk about the Spanish flu, they think it came from Spain, but it came from The US."|2:9;;2:57;;Its CRAZY too think which countries lost a lot of their life expectancy in WW2. You'd think Germany would be the biggest but Russia definitely is the winner (pretty much loser) there.|"3:16;;3:26;;They call the 19th Century Europe's century, they call the 20th century America's century, Seeing China get up there really reminds us of who's ""ahead"" in the 21st."|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:8;;0:22;;I like the idea of displayed all countries at once however the problem with this is that there is a lot of data points on the screen at once. Later on in the video when grey bubbles surround some countries dots, i believe this could be a better method to summarize interesting aspects of the video. For example the individual countries aren't labelled, it would be more useful if the geographic regions themselves were divided up into averages of income and health. Eg. A bubble for East Asia, Oceania, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Latin America, North America, South America, North Africa etc.|0:22;;0:24;;It did startle me to notice how low the life expectancy was in all the countries not even 200 years ago. I'm 22 and I would be well over halfway through my life if I was in the 1800s.|0:34;;0:41;;This is what I meant in my previous comment about the grey bubbles, I believe this could provide quicker more visual information to the viewer rather than the assortment of dots.|0:53;;1:5;;It is quite interesting how quickly Europe left behind most of the world in terms of income and life expectancy. It's interesting to note how much of an outlier the two red dots at around the 8k income mark are. Would these perhaps be the most 'westernized' Asian countries (such as Japan after the Meiji Restoration)?|1:10;;1:16;;It is honestly so shocking how badly the world was affected by WW1 and the Spanish Flu. Especially during the current pandemic it makes me glad that there's not a world war going on to make it worse.|1:27;;1:30;;It's interesting to note here that a few dots went far more to the left than they went down. Would this represent countries that spent their economy in fighting the war and the pandemic?|1:43;;1:48;;Comparing Seychelles and Mauritius was interesting during that segment.|1:59;;2:5;;I liked the highlighting of interesting country anomalies during this segment.|2:11;;2:20;;It's interesting to compare the difference of WW1 and WW2, where WW1 had the added affect of a pandemic, WW2 scatters the countries a lot more based on pure war effects on economy and life expectancy whereas WW1 everyone suffered because of the flu.|2:54;;3:7;;It's interesting during this section that this is the time where most of the world makes the most progress towards the top right. It took over 170 years for most countries to make the progress that a small subset of countries achieved quickly.|3:21;;3:27;;This section I found interesting because it shows how significantly affected African countries were by AIDS and compared to the rest of the world.|-|-|-|-|-
0:14;;0:27;;The different starting points of the continents is an ' 'interesting visual comparison|0:42;;0:56;;It is intriguing how the increase in income levels in Europe ' 'does not exactly correspond with an increase in life expectancy during this ' 'time.|1:0;;1:5;;Two countries in the Americas seem to be outliers.|1:6;;1:47;;The grey outlines around the countries in each continent make it ' 'easier to see continent-level movement trends.|1:6;;1:47;;The change in size and shape of the grey outlines also nicely ' 'highlights changes in inequality within each continent.|1:55;;2:7;;The labels on individual regions make it easier to see what is ' 'going on. I also like how the text stays stationary (easier to read).|2:58;;3:0;;China's position is very volatile here.|2:53;;3:30;;It is sad how much the income inequality has increased from the ' 'early 1800s until present.|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
0:23;;0:24;;It makes me very curious when I see a random country drop so suddenly. it would be interesting to have that country labelled so i can look it up afterwards and see why it dropped.|0:41;;0:42;;this was another example of where my eye was drawn to a country that dropped suddenly. I would have loved to know why.|0:42;;0:43;;I like the way Denmark, etc are labelled. I was curious which countries were the highest and was happy to see these labels.|0:50;;0:51;;I thought it was really interesting to see all the countries start to move across because of the industrial revolution. that the move was so sudden|1:4;;1:5;;it is interesting to see european countries start to really pull ahead|1:10;;1:12;;this was the part that really got my attention. the trace of the bubbles is so dramatic and works really well.|1:27;;1:29;;really interesting drop. i would have liked to have known which countries had the biggest drop.|1:57;;2:1;;I would like to have a little bit more info about Khazikstan and why life expectancy rose so much.|2:22;;2:28;;I like the way germany and russia are labelled. i would have liked to see UK as well. I am confused why Moldova is labelled? it makes me wonder did something important happen there then?|2:31;;2:33;;i see UK has appeared. I would have liked to have seen it earlier in the stats. it is interesting to see the russia, germany, uk relationships|2:46;;2:51;;I am interested to see how north korea and south korea perform against eachother.|2:58;;3:1;;i like the way everything is speeding across. i would be interested to know the top and bottom european countries, would be good if they were labelled.|2:57;;2:58;;the trivia at the bottom is really interesting here.|3:5;;3:7;;found it really interesting that some jumped directly to the top corner (Brunei etc). that is really fascinating.|3:26;;3:28;;it would be great to see more country labels here to get an idea of who is top and bottom.|-
0:9;;0:23;;Interesting that countries with larger populations ( larger ' 'bubbles) are the ones with lower life expectancies on average and vice versa smaller bubbles slightly closer to rich/healthy corner|0:28;;0:31;;As a red-green colour blind person, I appreciate fading out the ' 'other coloured bubbles / countries and highlighting certain continents (e.g ' 'Asia / red). Made it easier to understand overall.|0:42;;0:47;;Interesting to see countries like Norway and Denmark fluctuate ' 'in terms of like expectancy (up and down on the Y axis) in the early 1800s - ' 'makes me wonder if it was due to wars or famines.|0:49;;0:53;;This visual / time lapse also made me curious as to which ' 'countries were experiencing sudden drops in life expectancy during the late ' '19th / early 20th century, and why.|1:7;;1:12;;The sudden and dramatic drop in life expectancies here (due to ' 'the war and Spanish flu epidemic) made me want to find out which countries were unaffected (the bubbles that didn't 'drop', in the visual).|1:17;;1:24;;I liked seeing the bubbles rise and fall on the life expectancy ' 'axis - it helped me understand how countries can recover from things like ' 'war or disease, over time.|1:50;;1:52;;It was very quick, but I was interested to see the sudden drop ' 'in life expectancies for some countries in 1933 (due to the First World War, ' 'I assume).|1:57;;1:59;;I wondered why Kazakhstan and that region in particular ' 'experienced an increase in life expectancy in 1933 (rather than a decrease, ' 'as you might expect).|2:10;;2:18;;The way the different coloured bubbles / continents are ' 'represented and the way they moved helped me understand how the Second World War affected parts of the world differently.|2:18;;2:32;;Separately showing how each continent / group of countries were affected by the Second World War was a good way to help break all the ' 'information down and keep the visual easy to digest.|2:55;;3:0;;I really liked the individual labels on some of the countries - I ' 'know they were relevant to the information in that part of the video but I ' 'wish they had been there from the start.|-|-|-|-|-
0:11;;0:18;;I like the color segments / size of bubble way of displaying info on a 2 axis chart|0:37;;0:38;;Also like the year in the bottom right|1:13;;1:16;;intresting showing the ghost of 2 parts. Shows better how much things dropped duting the spanish flu|2:25;;2:46;;facts on the bottom are cool too. Clever way of lot of info for one graph|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
